- 👋 Hi, I’m @submarelime aka MaryAnn Vasquez. I am trying to launch my website. It's frustrating cuz all the templates have some element missing.
- 👀 I’m interested in ...learning how to code to build my website on my own cuz noone else sees what i see for my finished site. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...javascript, php, java, json, python, vbscript. i have security worries so i've been studying domains & namesrvs & dns & how the internet works.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate...with someone that can guide me by reviewing my output then give me some pointers on how to get better faster...
- 📫 How to reach me ...email: submarelime@yahoo.com
- Very glad to meet y'all! 
- @submarelime
